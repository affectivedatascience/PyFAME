## [1.0.0] 2025-10-02

### Added

- Major revisions and changes to the packages architecture over the last several months. We wanted to transition 
into a more modular, and more readable structure for applying PyFAME's manipulations. 
- Reframed manipulation functions as manipulation `Layer` instances. Each manipulation layer comes paired with a 
factory function of the same name, so that users don't have to deal with complex object-oriented programming paradigms.
- We also aimed to simplify the process of selecting and passing files to the manipulations. As such, PyFAME now uses a single top-level `make_paths()` method, which takes in a directory in your current working folder, and sets up some scaffolded subdirectories to make reading, writing and logging image and video files much simpler. 
    - By default, PyFAME will always try to create a new directory called `data`, but users can provide any location they would like the working folder to be written too. Inside this working folder `make_paths()` creates several subdirectories: `raw`, `processed`, `logs` and `analysis`. 
    - The `raw` and `processed` directories are where the raw image or video files, and the processed image or video files are read, and written to respectively. For each processing session, a uniquely timestamp-named folder is created under `processed/`, and it will contain all of the processed files from that specific session.
    - The `logs` folder similarly contains uniquely timestamp-named log files, which are now written out to JSON, as opposed to the previous plaintext and csv implementations. JSON was chosen as the ideal method of filing manipulation logs due to its human-readability, and its enforced structure and support from python packages like 
    `jsonschema` and `json`. Reproducability was a key focus with the new log files, and a new method `read_experiment_log()` has been created to solve this exact problem. `read_experiment_log()` takes in a manipulation log file, and returns you a list of the manipulation layers used, configured with the same parameters used in the original experiment. 
- Another reoccuring issue with earlier implementations was how to layer multiple manipulations together over the same file. Our solution to that issue is the new top-level `apply_layers(file_paths, layers)` method. `apply_layers` alongside the internal `LayerPipeline` class handle all the hard work of iterating over files and frames, configuring and operating the mediapipe `FaceLandmarker`, sequentially applying manipulations to the same frame, formatting and writing out log files, and writing out the processed input files all in a single call.
    - The goal in mind when designing the `apply_layers` method was to make it as simple as possible for inexperienced programmers to jump right in to using all of PyFAMES extensive manipulations, without the need to know how to work with image or video processing, configuring machine learning models with mediapipe, or complicated object-oriented programming paradigms like instantiation, waste collection, etc.
- The last major change is the encapsulation of layer input parameters in Pydantic models, for rapid and effective validation. All of the manipulation layers can be precisely temporally controlled using timing functions; now all of the timing parameters are contained in a useful helper class `TimingConfiguration()`. The timing configuration class has been set up with reasonable defaults for most situations, and as such can be passed directly to the layers as is, without needing to change any configurations.

### Changed

- As noted above, we have completely reworked PyFAME's underlying architecture and design structure preparing for the 
v1.0.0 release. The high-level changes and their justifications are as follows:
    - Transitioning from using the now deprecated mediapipe.solutions.FaceMesh to using the newer, actively supported 
    mediapipe.tasks.vision.FaceLandmarker. Almost every manipulation function in PyFAME relied on mediapipe's FaceMesh implementation, so a complete redesign was in order when migrating to mediapipe's newer equivalent FaceLandmarker. Additionally, the method by which the two models perform facial detection and tracking, the way in which they are instantiated, and the results they return differ quite drastically. 
    - Renaming and redefining landmark path constants was also a necessary step in PyFAME's redesign, as the new FacialLandmarker has 10 additional landmarks around the iris that previously were unimplimented in the FaceMesh solution. Several landmark indicies were renamed or moved, so PyFAME's previously defined landmark sets were no longer valid. The naming change reflects a higher degree of consistency with mediapipe's parameter names, and makes it easier to understand which constant is for what use case. 
        - Previously all of the landmark constants were referred to as PATHS. In order to avoid confusion in using both 'landmarks' and 'paths' to refer to the same thing, PyFAME now refers to all of its constant landmark sets as `LANDMARK_...`, for example `LANDMARK_FACE_OVAL` as opposed to the previous `FACE_OVAL_PATH`. Furthermore the PATH constants were too similar in name to several of the masking parameters (i.e. `FACE_OVAL_MASK`), further justifying the name change.
    - Remodling PyFAME's internal package structure for ease of navigation, scoping of functionality and upholding industry standards. PyFAME now contains 8 top-level submodules, namely `analyse`, `file_access`, `landmark`, `layer`, `logging`, `models`, `schema` and `utilities`. This structure reflects a more accurate scoping of the package's functionality, and makes it much simpler to navigate. The `layer` and `analyse` submodules contain the majority of user-exposed functionality, with the remaining functionality falling under `utilities`. Previous implementations of the manipulation functions were far to large, and contained a large amount of out-of-scope code. The new structure reflects the higher degree of modularity we are aiming for in v1.0.0.

### Removed
- Parameter check functions have been mostly removed, due to the lack of need now that PyFAME is using Pydantic models to validate its manipulation layer's parameters. 
- Some of the prior functionality in things like sparse/dense optical flow and the moviefy function is either completely rewritten or removed entirely and replaced with smaller, more in-scope implementations. For example, previous implementations of the optical flow functions would return analysis results and display visualised optical flow in the same call. These functionalities have now been split up, and rewritten into distinct analysis and manipulation methods.


## [0.7.3] 2025-04-12

### Added

- New package submodule has been defined; `moviefy`. `moviefy` contains two functions, `normalize_image_sizes()` and `moviefy_images()`. These functions allow you to convert a directory of images into a "movie" or video-like mp4 file. This is useful for applying video-only manipulations (such as point-light display, or temporal manipulations) to static images. `moviefy_images()` creates 'movies' by repeating frames and blending frames together to create a transitioning sequence of images that can be operated on like a video. The number of frame repeats versus transitional blended frames is determined by the input parameters `fps`, `repeat_duration`, and `blended_frames_prop`.
- `moviefy_images()` requires its input images to all be of the same size, shape and format. 
- `normalize_image_sizes()` provides two methods of normalizing the image sizes; NORMALIZE_IMAGES_CROP and NORMALIZE_IMAGES_PAD. These methods will match all of the images sizes to the smallest, and largest image size contained in `input_dir`, respectively. 

### Changed

- Package import method has been reworked. Previously, users would have to import pyfame.core to access the core functions, now .core by default is exposed with a top-level import `import pyfame`. 
- Specific commonly used .utils components are also exposed with a top-level import, including `predefined_constants`, `landmarks`, and `timing_functions`.

### Removed

## [0.7.2] 2025-03-10

### Added

- A full pytest test suite has been implemented, covering all of the main package functionality found in pyfame.core. The test suite automatically disables file logging when running tests (via conftest.py setting an env variable) as to not bloat up the log files.
- `exceptions.py` has been implemented, containing several custom exceptions aimed at handling unrecognized file extensions, and image file IO errors.

### Changed

- Pyfames package structure has been completely reworked into a more readable and modular format. Previously, all of the packages main functions were in a top level file pyfame.py. Pyfame's package structure is now as follows:
    - The top level package pyfame has two submodules `.core` and `.utils`
        - `.core` contains the packages main functions, which have been divied up into `analysis.py`, `coloring.py`, `occlusion.py`, `point_light_display.py`, `scrambling.py` and `temporal_transforms.py`.
        - all of the main functions are accessible via 'import pyfame.core'
        - `.utils` contains the packages utility functions, predefined landmark regions and global constants all previously found in a top level `pyfame_utils.py`
        - `.utils` has been divied up into `display_options.py`, `landmarks.py`, `predefined_constants.py` and `timing_functions.py`
        - all of the utility funtions are accessible via 'import pyfame.utils'
- `setup_logging()` has been moved to its own file `setup_logging.py` to avoid circular import errors. Additionally, the function now checks for an os.environ variable `PYTEST_RUNNING` prior to setting up the logging, in order to avoid writing file logs while running the test suite.
- Testing exposed several bugs with input parameters being read in as an uncooperative integer type. There were multiple cases of integer input params being read in as int64 rather than uint8 as cv2 expects, which did not raise a TypeError but resulted in corrupt file outputs. This has been patched in `mask_face_region()`, `occlude_face_region()`, and `generate_point_light_display()`.

### Removed

## [0.7.1] 2025-02-27

### Added

- Display functions have been implemented for all of the predefined constants, defined within pyfame_utils.py. Users can now simply call `display_shuffle_method_options()` for example, and the constants names and literal values will be printed to the terminal. 
- Normalised gaussian timing function has finally been implemented properly.

### Changed

- Function Docstrings and error messages have been made more comprehensive, and now reference display functions in pyfame_utils when encountering ValueErrors for input parameters.
- Bug fixes to several parameter error checks implemented with parameter file-logging.

### Removed

## [0.7.0] 2025-02-16

### Added

- New function `generate_shuffled_block_array()` has been implemented. This function was designed to be used alongside `shuffle_frame_order()` in order to abstract the block ordering from the user. `generate_shuffled_block_array()` takes in a file_path, shuffle_method and block_duration (in milliseconds) and returns a tuple of (block_order, block_size). This output can now directly be fed as an input parameter to `shuffle_frame_order()`, and `shuffle_frame_order()` will now call `generate_shuffled_block_array()` internally if no block_order is provided.
- Several new frame shuffling methods have been added including random sampling with replacement, left and right cyclic shift, palindrome shuffling and frame interleaving. 
- All functions now make use of logging. Standard logs can be found at PyFAME/logs/app.log. This file will be cycled once it reaches 5mb, and the last 5 log files will be stored in the logs folder. Error logs can be found at PyFAME/logs/error.log. This file will be rotated in a similar manner to the standard log. All functions now log their input parameters, various status updates on execution, and all parameter or execution errors that are raised.
- Logging configurations can be found in the PyFAME/config folder in `log_config.yaml`

### Changed

- Several internal changes to `shuffle_frame_order()`. Many of the array-randomizing functionalities have been rescoped to 
`generate_shuffled_block_array()`.
- Shuffle_methods have been given a new naming scheme, all of the constant variable names follow the following format: FRAME_SHUFFLE_{method name}.
- Bug fixes to `get_optical_flow()`, specifically the dense optical flow implementation a bug fix was required over the writing of flow vectors to a csv file.
- `Extract_face_color_means()` can now handle static images, on top of video files.

### Removed

## [0.6.7] - 2025-01-18

### Added

- Function `shuffle_frame_order()` can now take an input parameter `block_order`, a list of integers. When `block_order` is provided, `block_size` will be automatically computed based on the length of the block order list. For example, given a block order of [1,0,3,2,4,5], the function will compute `block_size` by taking the total frame count and dividing it by the length of the list.

### Changed

- Function `get_optical_flow()` now takes a parameter `optical_flow_type`. The function now includes the option to compute Farneback's dense optical flow on top of Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow. Several other Farneback control parameters have been added to the function, but have all been defined with defaults and typical values in the function documentation.
- Furthermore, due to the sheer size of outputted csv files from `get_optical_flow()`, a new parameter `csv_sample_freq` has been added. This value (given in milliseconds) determines how frequently the function will write out optical flow vectors to the outputted csv file. This is implemented using a rolling time window, and comparing the current video timestamp with its value at each iteration of the running loop.

### Removed

## [0.6.6] - 2025-01-11

### Added

- New function `shuffle_frame_order()` has been implemented. The function has two running modes: `SHUFFLE_FRAME_ORDER` and `REVERSE_FRAME_ORDER`. Frames are read from the input video and stored in blocks, who's size is determined by input parameter `block_size`. Given an input video running at 30 fps, the default `block_size` of 30 will shuffle the order of roughly 1 second segments of the video file. The output order of the frame blocks is determined randomly. Users may pass a `rand_seed` to seed the rng for reproducable results.

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.6.5] - 2025-01-02

### Added

- Function `point_light_display()` has been further expanded. Now the function can display point displacement history, which can be drawn on the output file in one of two methods. Displacement history can be toggled on and off using the input parameter `show_history`. `SHOW_HISTORY_ORIGIN` will draw the displacement vector for each point relative to their original positions in frame 1. `SHOW_HISTORY_RELATIVE` will draw each points path history, displaying each path segment for a set amount of time given by input parameter `history_window_msec`.

### Changed

- Previously, removing points to satisfy the `point_density` was done purely randomly. However this caused issues abstracting the shapes of the landmark regions, making them difficult to identify. Point removal has been reimplemented using a normal gaussian distribution to control which points are removed and which are retained. As a result, even at lower densities the points stay clustered as to maintain the shape of the landmark they are tracking.
- Point size and color were previously hard-coded values. New parameters `point_color`, `point_radius`, and `history_color` allow the user to customize how the functions outputs appear.

### Removed

## [0.6.4] - 2024-12-30

### Added

- New function `point_light_display()` has been implemented. The function utilises the 478 landmark points tracked by the mediapipe FaceMesh to generate a point-light display of the face. The default functionality displays all 478 landmark points. However, users may provide landmark sets or predefined landmark sets from `pyfameutils` to the input parameter `landmarks_regions` to further specify which regions or landmarks will be included in the functions output. 
- Users may wish to manipulate the number of points without affecting the overall shape of the landmark regions. In order to do so, users may provide a floating point density to the input parameter `point_density`.

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.6.3] - 2024-12-22

### Added

- Expanded functionality for function `get_optical_flow()`. Now beyond outputing the visualised optical flow vectors, the function will output a csv containing the timestamp, previous and current (x,y) positions, vector magnitude, vector angle, status and error rate for each tracked point at every frame. 

### Changed

- `get_optical_flow()` has now been fully parameterized. The Lucas-Kanade optical flow control parameters were previously hard-coded values, but are now available to be passed as input parameters with predefined defaults. New parameters include `max_corners`, `corner_quality_lvl`, `min_corner_distance`, `win_size`, `max_pyr_lvl`, `max_lk_iter` and `lk_accuracy_thresh`.
- Both `point_color` and `vector_color` are now available as input parameters.

### Removed

## [0.6.2] - 2024-12-17

### Added

- New function `get_optical_flow()` has been implemented. The function makes use of the Shi-Tomasi corners algorithm to find good points to track, and passes these points on to the Lucas-Kanade sparse optical flow algorithm. At each new frame, the function draws a point over the current positions of the good points list, then using inter-frame movement draws motion vector histories of each point overtop of the input file. 
- Alternatively to using the Shi-Tomasi good corners algorithm, the user may provide a set of FaceMesh landmark id's to track within the input parameter `landmarks_to_track`.

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.6.1] - 2024-12-09

### Added

### Changed

- Bug causing grid-scramble order to be recomputed midway through file processing has been fixed.
- Bug causing jittery movement of facial landmarks when using `LANDMARK_SCRAMBLE` with video files has been fixed.

### Removed

## [0.6.0] - 2024-12-07

### Added

- Function `facial_scramble()` now takes an input parameter `scramble_method`. Three new scrambling methods have been defined within `pyfameutils`. These include `LOW_LEVEL_GRID_SCRAMBLE`, `HIGH_LEVEL_GRID_SCRAMBLE` and `LANDMARK_SCRAMBLE`.
- Landmark based scrambling is a new addition to the function. It takes the eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth, and randomly swaps their positions and orientation. In order to provide seamless gaps between the underlying face and the manipulated landmark regions, the landmarks are cut out and stored, then the holes in the image are filled using the Telea image inpainting algorithm. Telea inpainting fills the image holes with a smooth gradient sampled from nearest neighbouring pixels.
- In order to seamlessly paste the facial landmarks back onto the face, cv2's SeamlessClone() method was used to ensure proper blending of landmark edges into the facial skin tone. 

### Changed

- Grid-based scrambling has been subdivided into `LOW_LEVEL_GRID_SCRAMBLE` and `HIGH_LEVEL_GRID_SCRAMBLE`. High level grid scrambling will function the same as previously implemented, with fully random shuffling of grid squares. Low level grid scrambling will make use of a new parameter `GRID_SCRAMBLE_THRESHOLD`; which defines the max x or y distance that a particular grid square can be moved from its original position.
- In order to reduce computation time from recomputing grid-square positions at each frame, the shuffled grid order is now precomputed prior to the functions main running loop. Beyond the grid-shuffle order, both grid-shuffling methods are implemented essentially the same. So precomputing the shuffle order allows for the removal of many lines of duplicate code.
- Many papers performing these types of facial scrambling/shuffling operate over grayscale images and video. As such `facial_scramble` now includes input parameter `out_grayscale` in order to toggle grayscale and color outputs.

### Removed

## [0.5.9] - 2024-12-02

### Added

- New function `facial_scramble` has been implemented. This function currently can perform grid-based shuffling of the face. Input parameter `grid_square_size` specifies the square dimensions (in pixels) of each grid square, and is used to compute the optimal grid arrangement to encapsulate the entire face with minimal background inclusions. 
- The grid shuffle order is computed randomly using NumPy's `default_rng()`. A random seed may be passed as an input parameter to ensure reproducable outputs. 

### Changed

### Removed

## [0.5.8] - 2024-11-24

### Added

- Bug fixes for `apply_noise()`.
- `apply_noise()` has been further expanded to include masking capabilities, and is now compatible with all predefined mask variables available in `pyfameutils`.

### Changed

### Removed

- Removed `random` as a dependency; all random operations are now computed using NumPy's random generator class.

## [0.5.7] - 2024-11-20

### Added

- New function `apply_noise()` has been implemented. This function provides three noise operations to select from; 
'pixelate', 'gaussian' and 'salt and pepper'. 
- `apply_noise()` provides a variety of customization options such as specifying the noise probability, mean and standard
deviation of the gaussian curve to be sampled from, as well as a random seed to be passed to the numpy random number generator. 
- An expanded set of masking options has been added to pyfameutils.MASK_OPTIONS for use with `mask_face_region()`. `mask_face_region` now also allows the user to specify the background color of output files via a BGR integer color code. 

### Changed

- Previous masking options FACE_OVAL and FACE_OVAL_TIGHT have been removed and replaced by the singular FACE_OVAL_MASK in hopes to alleviate any user confusion between the two options previously. 
- PsyFace has been officially renamed to PyFAME: the Python Facial Analysis and Manipulation Environment.

### Removed

## [0.5.6] - 2024-11-12

### Added

- Bug fixes for last major feature update (v0.5.5).
- `CHIN_PATH` has been added as a predefined path for use with all facial manipulation functions.
- `extract_color_channel_means` has been renamed as `extract_face_color_means`. The function now will not only output full-facial means, but also regional color means in the cheek, nose and chin areas for all colour spaces. 

### Changed

- The Hemi-face family of landmark paths have been converted to standard paths, and no longer require in-place computation. 
- `occlude_face_region`'s implementation of bar-style occlusion has been reworked, such that now the occluding bar will track correctly with the position of the face and axis of the head (the occluding bar no longer remains paralell to the horizontal axis).
- `face_color_shift`, `face_saturation_shift` and `face_brightness_shift` now only take list[list[tuple]] for input parameter `landmark_regions`. This massively reduces the ammount of duplicate code previously divided among if-else statements based on what was passed to `landmark_regions`.

### Removed

## [0.5.3 - 0.5.5] - 2024-10-16

### Added

- Major feature updates to all facial manipulation functions. `face_color_shift`, `face_saturation_shift`, `face_brightness_shift` and `blur_face_region` now are all compatible with timing functions, and every predefined landmark region defined within `psyfaceutils.py`. 
- Some of the landmark paths have been redefined as placeholders, as they either need to be calculated in place (hemi-face regions) or require a different method to draw the landmark polygons (Cheek landmark regions form concave polygons).
- `FACE_SKIN_PATH` constant has been defined in order to provided easier access to facial skin colouring, leaving the lips and eyes untouched. For similar ease of use reasons, other commonly used grouped regions have been defined, including `CHEEKS_PATH` and `CHEEKS_NOSE_PATH` for use in facial "blushing".

### Changed

### Removed

- Bad practice global variable declarations have been removed entirely. 

## [0.5.2] - 2024-10-09

### Added

- `Occlude_face_region` can now perform vertical and horizontal hemi-face occlusion. Hemi-face masks rely on the facial screen coords, thus they cannot be precomputed. However, predefined placeholder constants `HEMI_FACE_TOP`, `HEMI_FACE_BOTTOM`, `HEMI_FACE_LEFT`, and `HEMI_FACE_RIGHT` have been defined and can still be passed in `landmarks_to_occlude` as any of the other predefined landmark paths can. 
- Helper function `compute_line_intersection` has been created and can be found in `psyfaceutils.py`.
- Additional masking option `EYES_NOSE_MOUTH_MASK` has been added to `mask_face_region`.

### Changed

### Removed

- Predefined landmark paths `UPPER_FACE_PATH` and `LOWER_FACE_PATH` have been removed, and replaced with `HEMI_FACE_TOP`, and `HEMI_FACE_BOTTOM` respectively.

## [0.5.1] - 2024-10-03

### Added

- `Blur_face_region` provides dynamic facial blurring functionality with several blurring methods (average, gaussian, median) over user-specified facial regions. 
- Added horizontal hemi-face occlusion, `UPPER_FACE_PATH` and `LOWER_FACE_PATH` constants can be found in psyfaceutils.py.

### Changed

- `Face_luminance_shift` has been replaced with `face_brightness_shift`. `Face_brightness_shift` will now take an integer shift value in the range [-255, 255], with -255 and 255 representing pure black and white respectively. 

### Removed

- `Face_luminance_shift` has been removed due to buggy behaviour when manipulating image luminance.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-09-24

### Added

- Package documentation is now built with MKDocs
- `Face_saturation_shift` and `Face_luminance_shift` are now standalone functions, where previously saturation and luma parameters were passed to the Face_color_shift function. 
- Github.io hosting for documentation page, as well as refactored github landing page and readme.md.
- License.txt added to root project structure.

### Changed

- `Shift_color_temp` was refactored to be a nested function within `Face_color_shift`, saturation and luminance shifting were relocated to their own specific functions. 
- Floodfilling operation involved with foreground-background seperation had some buggy behaviour if there was any discontinuity in the background. An intermediate step was added where prior to floodfilling, the thresholded image is padded with a 10 pixel border, which is removed after the floodfill. This border ensures background continuity when performing the floodfill operation.
- Parameters `max_color_shift` and `max_sat_shift` are now renamed to `shift_magnitude`.

### Removed

- Sphinx and readthedocs project files and dependencies

## [0.4.2] - 2024-08-24

### Added

- Sphinx dependency for autodocumentation.
- Rst files defining the documentation build. 

### Changed

- Updated readme.md with examples, licenses and link to documentation page

### Removed

## [0.4.1] - 2024-08-18

### Added

### Changed

- v0.4.1 bug fixes for processing directories of mixed file types (images and videos). 

### Removed

## [0.4.0] - 2024-08-17

### Added

### Changed

- v0.4 Refactored all methods; moved repetative frame operations to nested functions for increased readability.
- Fixed buggy behaviour when working with still images over all methods. On top of video formats .MP4 and .MOV, you can now perform facial masking, occlusion and colour shifting over image formats .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .bmp.
- Increased error handling; methods should now be able to process large directories of mixed file formats efficiently in a single call. 

### Removed

## [0.3.1] - 2024-08-11

### Added

- v0.3.1 Support for nose masking and occluding

### Changed

- Added bar-style occlusion options to occlude_face_region(). You can now perform bar-style occlusion on the eyes, nose 
and mouth regions. 

### Removed

## [0.3.0] - 2024-08-02

### Added

- v0.3 occlude_face_region()

### Changed

- Redefined the naming convention used for constants in utils.py

### Removed

## [0.2.2] - 2024-07-31

### Added

### Changed

- Changed mp4 video codec from h264 to cv2 supported mp4v.
- Mask_face_region and face_color_shift now take confidence parameters for the underlying mediapipe face landmarker model.
- Implemented otsu thresholding to isolate foreground to use as a mask. This foreground mask ensures that no background 
artifacts are present in the facial color shifting, or facial masking. 
- Added documentation for new function parameters.

### Removed

## [0.2.1] - 2024-07-24

### Added

- v0.2.1 transcode_video_to_mp4()

### Changed

- All functions will work by default with .mp4 and .mov video files. If an older container is being used, 
see transcode_video_to_mp4 to convert video codecs.
- Bug fixes with facial mask in face_color_shift; removed background artifacts present in the masked facial region.

### Removed
- Removed dependancy ffprobe-python.

## [0.2.0] - 2024-07-21

### Added

- v0.2 added dependancy ffprobe-python.

### Changed
